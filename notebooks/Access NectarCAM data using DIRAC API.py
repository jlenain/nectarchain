# # How to access NectarCAM data from the EGI grid directly using through DIRAC within `nectarchain` ?
#
# In this short notebook, we will see how to access data stored on the grid through DIRAC within `nectarchain` itself, without the hassle of first manually downloading them locally.
#
# In order to achieve this, you will obviously need a `conda` environment in which all relevant code is installed, such as `ctapipe`, `nectarchain`, but also `CTADIRAC` itself. Please refer to the `nectarchain` installation procedure at <https://github.com/cta-observatory/nectarchain> and follow the instructions to enable DIRAC support.
#
# You will also need to have an active proxy for EGI, initialized e.g. with:
#
# ```
# dirac-proxy-init -M -g cta_nectarcam
# ```
#
# You can also check whether you currently have an active proxy with the command `dirac-proxy-info`.

dm = DataManagement()
dm.findrun(6881)

# %% [markdown]
# Once the files are downloaded, the same command will *not* fetch them again, but will detect that the data are already locally present:

# %%
dm.findrun(6881)

# It is also possible to fetch data using the DIRAC API directly. Under the hood, this is exactly what is done within `nectarchain` in the example above.
